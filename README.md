# svgtest
This is a very simple little experiment set up to look at the ways I can manipulate SVG files that are generated in Adobe Illustartor which should form part of a larger project.

It's been set up as a straightforward Node app with Gulp to render CSS and HTML, Express to deliver the pages to the browser.

Currently there is an issue with Gulp creating duplicate files in the web root!
